# What did you do to my token?
I have collected information about it and added it to my database and then invalidated it. Nothing more, nothing less

# How did you get so many tokens?
I keep that private as to not guide malicious people into doing the same

# How much for the tool?
I'm not going to sell any ""tool"". The whole purpose of this project is to bother the ones stealing tokens, not selling a tool so someone can get free tokens.

# How to keep your bot token safe
Please use ENV variables so if some bad actor finds your bot he cannot use your token to nuke your server/other servers

# Nonsense issues
All nonsense issues will be closed and deleted a short time afterwards and the user will be blocked. I'm not wasting time with 12yo that copy and paste code

# U mad? 
Ok skid + stay mad + cry harder + didnt ask + got ur token lol + dont care
