# What did you do to my token?
I have collected information about it, added it to my database and then invalidated it. Nothing more, nothing less.

# Why did you get my token again?
If you actually stored the token somewhere else instead of just replacing it with a new one, this probably means it was leaked again somehow, probably by accidentally uploading your file that contained the token.

# How did you get so many tokens?
I keep that to myself as to not guide malicious people into doing the same.

# How much for the tool?
I'm not going to sell any ""tool"". The whole purpose of this project is to bother the ones stealing tokens, not selling a tool so someone can get free tokens.

# How to keep your bot token safe
Please use environment variables so if some bad actor finds your bot it cannot use your token with malicious intents (such as nuking servers).
Make sure these environment variables are never re-uploaded anywhere, which (if you're just using git) is done easier by using a [`.gitignore`](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_ignore.asp) file.

# Nonsense issues
All nonsense issues will be closed and deleted a short time afterwards. The user will also be blocked. I'm not wasting time with 12 year olds that copy and paste code.

# U mad? 
Ok skid + stay mad + cry harder + didnt ask + got ur token lol + dont care
