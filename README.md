Sadly however there are a few small side effects, however those do not directly affect the users but rather the people that posted these tokens. You may except any of the following:

## Side effects:
Upset scammers, phishers, fake QR-code scammers.
Scammers, phishers, fake QR-code creators losing a lot of stolen tokens.
Scammers, phishers, fake QR-code creators getting unreasonably mad.

However, since this is in the best interest of the users, we’ll not be resolving those side effects. In fact, we welcome their attention towards this repository. We like to hear malicious actors cry.

We now wish to answer a few questions that have arisen from the scammers, phishers, and fake QR-code scammers.

## FAQ
> Where did you find my token?

This repository is automatically published to by multiple tools and automated scanning processes across the internet.

> Why publish tokens to Github?

Because this is the easiest way to invalidate tokens within Discord’s Terms of Service.

> Why did you "steal" my token?

We did not. We helped you by making it invalid, so people that do the same thing as us but with a malicious intent don't abuse your token.

> Will you stop publishing our tokens?

Absolutely not! We very much appreciate legitimate users, hence we’ll continue supporting them with this repository to help them make your life even more miserable!

> I am very mad!

Ok skid cry harder
